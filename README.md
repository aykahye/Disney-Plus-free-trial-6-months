# Disney+ Free Trial: Get 6 Months of Disney+ for Free!

Disney+ has long been known for offering an incredible range of entertainment, from Disney classics to Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, and National Geographic content. While Disney+ has discontinued its standard free trial, there are still opportunities to get up to 6 months of Disney+ for free, typically through specific promotions or partnerships.

One of the most popular ways to score a 6-month free Disney+ subscription is through bundling offers with other services or products. For example, certain mobile carriers, like Verizon, have previously provided promotions where new or existing customers could receive a 6-month Disney+ free trial when signing up for a specific plan or purchasing a particular product.

Additionally, some credit card companies and retailers occasionally partner with Disney+ to offer limited-time trials, including the generous 6-month option. These partnerships usually come with specific terms and conditions, such as signing up for an annual plan or making a qualifying purchase.

Itâ€™s important to note that while a 6-month free trial is a fantastic opportunity, such offers are generally time-sensitive and subject to availability. Keep an eye on Disney+ announcements, partner promotions, and retail deals for the latest opportunities to access Disney+ without paying for the first several months.

Remember, after the trial ends, the subscription will automatically renew unless you cancel it before the trial period concludes. Always review the terms and conditions to avoid unwanted charges.
